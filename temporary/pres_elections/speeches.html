<br /><br /><br />
<h3>The canidates</h3>
<p>  As you may know, the Monkay first presidential election is coming up. There are so far, 2 people running,
one of which has prepared their speech and has fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/XHJbPJh7Bd5cnAPs5" target="_blank">form</a>.</p>
<p>The two people so far running are Ella and Eli.</p>
<h4>Ella's Speech</h4>
<p>The folowing is directly from Ella's speech: <blockquote>
"If I became the president of the Monkays, I would change some things to make us a better group. Hereâ€™s what what would happen:
<p>* We would continue our work on the base, and try to get it done soon. We would also spend some time on repairs to the base.</p>
<p>*We would get our base organized, and make sure everyone knows where everything is.</p>
<p>*We would collect lots of supplies (such as sticks and snowballs) so we would always be prepared for an attack.</p>
<p>*We would decide on a currency, and we would not be forced to use it, you could use it (or not use it) whenever you wanted, and you could also trade.</p>
<p>*We would send spy teams to get info on the Hammerheads, and stay on top of them.</p>
<p>* If the Hammerheads attacked or wrecked our base, we would only do small things to them, like steal some sticks."</p>
</blockquote></p>
